Description -
•	Face recognition using MathWorks on Raspberry Pi is a process of identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features using the MathWorks software platform and implementing it on a Raspberry Pi device. The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost, single-board computer that is widely used for various applications.
•	Implementing face recognition on a Raspberry Pi using MathWorks involves leveraging the computational capabilities of the Raspberry Pi and the comprehensive toolset provided by MathWorks, such as MATLAB and Simulink. 
•	The process typically includes capturing images or video frames using a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi, preprocessing the data to enhance the quality and reduce noise, applying face detection algorithms to locate faces, extracting facial features, comparing the features with the stored templates in the database, and making the final identification or verification decision.
•	By combining the power of MathWorks software and the flexibility of the Raspberry Pi platform, face recognition can be implemented on embedded systems, enabling real-time or near-real-time applications such as access control, surveillance, attendance systems, and more.
